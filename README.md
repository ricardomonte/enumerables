## Project 2: Enumerable Methods

In this project we:

- Used Ruby to implement the algorithm.
- Created a script file to house the following methods: my_each, my_each_with_index, my_select, my_all?, my_any?, my_none?, my_count, my_map and my_inject.

# What it does

 Our Enumerable module mixin provides collection classes with several traversal and searching methods, and with the ability to sort. 
 The class must provide a method each, which yields successive members of the collection.
